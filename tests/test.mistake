comment Trying to get closer to hardware implementations, you are able to use a "stack" to run functions as well.
comment "push" is a function that pushes the parameter onto the top of the stack
comment "stack" is a function that takes in a function, and calls said function with the data at the top of the stack.
comment "stack" also removes the data from the top of the stack.

comment Pushes 5 onto the stack, then 7.
|>| 5 end
|>| 7 end

comment Adds 7 and 5
!? |<| |<| + end

comment Multiplies 5 and the data at the top of the stack
comment As there is no data, the multiplication function will simply not be called in order to soften your mistake
|<| * 5 end
